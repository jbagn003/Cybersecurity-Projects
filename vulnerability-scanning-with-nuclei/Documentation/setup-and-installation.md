## Setup & Installation Guide

This section outlines the steps used to configure the lab environment for this project, including virtual machine setup, networking configuration, and tool installation. The purpose of this guide is to document how the environment was created before recon and creation of specific templates to scan the known explotions within the Metasploitable virtual machine.

### 1️⃣ Required Software

The following software was used in this lab:

- **Virtualization Platform:**  
  - VirtualBox (used in this project)  
  - VMware may also be used as an alternative

- **Target Machine:**  
  - Metasploitable2 (intentionally vulnerable Linux system)

- **Attacker / Scanner Machine:**  
  - Kali Linux

- **Security Tools:**  
  - Nuclei (vulnerability scanner)  
  - Wireshark (network traffic analysis)

### 2️⃣ Virtual Machine Setup

#### Importing Virtual Machines
1. Install VirtualBox (or VMware).
2. Import the Metasploitable2 virtual machine image.
3. Create or import a Kali Linux virtual machine.

Both virtual machines should be powered off before configuring networking.

### 3️⃣ Network Configuration (NAT Network)

To ensure isolated communication between the attacker and target systems, both virtual machines were configured on the same NAT network.

1. Open **VirtualBox → File → Tools → Network Manager**
2. Create a **NAT Network**
3. Assign the NAT network to:
   - Kali Linux → Network Adapter
   - Metasploitable2 → Network Adapter
4. Start both virtual machines

This configuration allows the machines to communicate with each other while remaining isolated from the host network.

### 4️⃣ Verify Connectivity

On the Metasploitable2 machine:
```bash
ifconfig
```

Note the assigned IP address.

On Kali Linux:
```bash
ping <Metasploitable-IP>
```

Successful responses confirm proper network connectivity.

### 5️⃣ Installing Go (Required for Nuclei)

Nuclei requires Go to be installed.

On Kali Linux:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang -y
```

Verify installation:
```bash
go version
```

### 6️⃣ Installing Nuclei

Download and install Nuclei:
```bash
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest
```

Add Go binaries to PATH if needed:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
```

Verify installation:
```bash
nuclei -version
```
### 7️⃣ Running Scans

Example scan command:
```bash
nuclei -u http://<Metasploitable-IP> -t my-YAML-templates/
```

Individual templates can be run by specifying the filename.
