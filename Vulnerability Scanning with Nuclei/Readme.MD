# Vulnerability Scanning & Network Traffic Analysis Lab

This project demonstrates a hands-on vulnerability assessment performed in an isolated home lab environment. The goal of this lab is to understand how vulnerabilities are discovered, validated, and observed at the network level from a defensive cybersecurity perspective.

The lab combines service discovery, custom vulnerability scanning, and packet analysis to show how attack activity may appear in real-world monitoring environments.

## 🔧 Lab Environment

- **Attacker / Scanner:** Kali Linux
- **Target:** Metasploitable2 (intentionally vulnerable system)
- **Network:** Isolated NAT network (VirtualBox)
- **Tools Used:**
  - Nmap
  - Nuclei (custom YAML templates)
  - Wireshark
  - Apache Mutillidae (vulnerable web app)

---

## 🧭 Assessment Workflow

1. **Reconnaissance:** Identify exposed services using Nmap
2. **Vulnerability Validation:** Use custom Nuclei templates to confirm specific issues
3. **Network Analysis:** Capture and analyze scan traffic with Wireshark
4. **Risk & Remediation:** Assess impact and outline mitigation strategies

## 🔍 Reconnaissance (Nmap)

Initial service discovery was performed to identify running services and versions on the target system.
To identify exposed services relevant to the vulnerability assessment, a targeted Nmap scan was performed against the Metasploitable host.

**Example command:**
```bash
nmap -sV -p 21,80,3632 10.0.2.4
```
This scan focuses only on services that were later validated using custom Nuclei templates. Results of the scan can be seen below.
